<h1 align="left">Hello ðŸ‘‹ <br>Welcome to my github profile</h1>

<p align="left">My name is Benjamin and I'm a web developer who was born and raised near Cologne. Since I was a child,
I've been passionate about technology and computer science. Ever since I came into
contact with coding, I have been very enthusiastic. I like to try out new things,
libraries and frameworks to make great software!</p>

<p align="left">Apart from programming, I am an enthusiastic gamer. From almost all Square Enix
games, like Kingdom Hearts or Final Fantasy, which accompanied my youth, to
Baldur's Gate and fantastic titles from Nintendo, such as Zelda or Super Smash
Bros. When I am not at the computer, I spend a lot of time on the football field
as an assistant coach for a local club or cheer for my favorite team, 1. FC
KÃ¶ln.</p>
